  lorePart1: 'The kapre is a Philippine cryptid creature with the appearance of an
    phenomenally tall, long-legged, god type of hairy humanoid, that sits in big
    trees and smokes cigars. It is often seen waiting for people as they walk through
    a path. '
  lorePart2: ' It scares away little children who play at night. If you''re stuck
    in a place and you keep going around in circles, you''re said to be played around
    by a kapre. To escape its control, you must remove your shirt/clothing, and wear
    it inside-out.


    The term kapre comes from the Arabic word "kaffir", meaning
    a non-believer in Islam. The early Arabs and the Moors used it to refer to the
    non-Muslim Indians who were dark-skinned. The term "kaffir" was also used for
    Papuan slaves brought to the Philippines by the Portuguese before slavery was
    abolished by Spain.'
  lorePart3: 
  personalityPart1: 'Kapres may make contact with people to offer friendship, or
    if it is attracted to a woman. If a kapre befriends any human, especially because
    of love, the kapre will consistently follow its "love interest" throughout life. '
  personalityPart2: 'Also, if one is a friend of the kapre then that person has the
    ability to see it and if they were to sit on it then any other person could see
    it. This proves kapres are the "friendly type" of humanoid.


    In some versions,
    the kapre is supposed to hold a magical white stone, smaller in size than a quail
    egg. Should any person happen to obtain this stone, the kapre could grant wishes.'
  personalityPart3: 'Kapre is a filthy, gorilla-like dark giant humanoid characterized
    as a tree demon. It is described as being tall (between 7 to 9 ft), brown, hairy
    male with a beard. Kapres are normally described as smoking a very large ganja
    pipe, whose strong smell would almost always attract human attention. But a kapre''s
    most least known, but probably most horrendous feature is the fact that it reeks
    of goat.



    The kapre is said to wear the indigenous Northern Philippine
    loincloth known as bahag, and according to some, it wears a belt which gives
    the Kapre the ability to be invisible to humans.'
