  lorePart1: "It is believed that there is a black chick living inside the creature.
    This is passed on from the deathbed of those afflicted to another person who
    is usually a relative. The chick is then believed to reside inside the body of
    the Manananggal eating the innards of its host while keeping them alive. \r\n"
  lorePart2: It is this that is believed to be the reason why the Manananggal craves
    the taste of human blood and flesh and transforms into its hideous shape.
  lorePart3: 
  personalityPart1: 'The Manananggal chooses an isolated place where she will leave
    her lower torso while she hunts at night. When she separates from her lower torso,
    she then gains the ability to fly. She then goes off in search of houses where
    pregnant women reside. '
  personalityPart2: "Upon choosing a suitable victim, the Manananggal alights on
    the house and inserts her tongue through the roof. The tongue is long, hollow,
    and extremely flexible. She uses it to puncture the womb of the sleeping woman
    and to suck out the fetus. \n\nAt other times, she seduces men with her beauty
    and lures them to a private place before eating them alive. She usually eats
    the insides, like the heart, stomach, or the liver"
