  m_Name: Tikbalang Info
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  lorePart1: "In Philippine mythology, the tikbalang is a half-human and half-horse
    creature and it\u2019s very similar to the centaur in Greek mythology. It\u2019s
    believed that a tikbalang would scare away travelers or lead them astray. In
    order to break free from this, the creature would require the lost individual
    to turn his clothes inside out. "
  lorePart2: "These experiences usually happen in rural and dark areas and especially
    after sunset.\r\n\r\nTikbalang may have originated from Hayagriva, an avatar
    of the Hindu god Vishnu, whose worship was first recorded in 2000 BCE. Before
    the Spanish arrived in the Philippines, there were no horses in the area so the
    history of a horse shaped creature was not possible. In the pre-colonial period,
    tikbalang were regarded as spirits of the forests and ghosts and they were also
    referred to as \u201Cmulto\u201D and \u201Cbibit\u201D. "
  lorePart3: In some versions, it is a transformation of an aborted foetus sent to
    earth from limbo.
  personalityPart1: 'Contrary to popular belief, the tikbalang is not a centaur.
    It can be described a being a reverse centaur as the centaur has the body of
    a horse and the torso and head of a man, the tikbalang has the head of a horse
    and the body of a human. '
  personalityPart2: 'The tikbalang is a tall, thin creature with a disproportionately
    long and disproportionately large limbs to the point that its knees reach above
    its head when it squats down. It has a thick mane and a lighter colour fur.


    Some
    accounts also claim that the eyes of the tikbalang glow like embers and there
    is some fiery glow associated with it when enraged.'
