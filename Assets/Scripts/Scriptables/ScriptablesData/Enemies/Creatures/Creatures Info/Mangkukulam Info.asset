  personalityPart2: ' Their wisdom is sought after for both healing and protective
    purposes. They are often portrayed as solitary figures, living on the outskirts
    of communities, away from mainstream society. They may keep to themselves, maintaining
    a certain distance due to their perceived powers.'
  personalityPart3: Throughout the annals of history, Mangkukulam have been subjected
    to persecution and discrimination, largely stemming from the stigma associated
    with their craft. The Catholic Church and colonial authorities regarded them
    as a potential threat to the ascendancy of Christianity and made concerted efforts
    to suppress their practices. Consequently, many Mangkukulam were compelled to
    operate covertly, concealing their remarkable talents from the prying eyes of
    the public.
