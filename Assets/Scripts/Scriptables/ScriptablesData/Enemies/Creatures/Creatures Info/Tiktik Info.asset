  lorePart1: 'The tiktik is described as having long limbs, keen claws, and the capacity
    to change into other forms. Its predatory instincts are what set it apart. Though
    it has a reputation for being frightening, there are stories that claim the tiktik
    can change shape during the day to resemble a person, allowing it to blend in
    and hide its true nature. '
  lorePart2: The Western Visayan regions, including Capiz, Iloilo, Negros, Bohol,
    Masbate, Aklan, and Antique, are particularly known for its popularity. The aswang
    is also known by its other regional names, "tik-tik," "wak-wak," and "soc-soc,"
    which refer to the noise it makes as it pursues victims.
  lorePart3: 
  personalityPart1: Tiktik appear at night to prey on careless travelers or individuals
    who are sleeping. They are reported to have a strange preference for the flavor
    of human liver. Pregnant women's fetuses are also reported to appeal to tiktik

    which to them smells like ripe jackfruit.
