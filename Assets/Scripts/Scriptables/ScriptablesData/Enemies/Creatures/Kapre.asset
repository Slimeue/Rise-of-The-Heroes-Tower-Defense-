  enemyLore: "The Kapre is a type of mythical creature in the Philippines that\u2019s
    commonly referred to as a tree demon. It\u2019s described as a tall and hairy
    brown-haired creature with a strong smell. In addition, it\u2019s believed that
    these individuals would typically smoke a tobacco pipe, which would draw the
    attention of humans. Kapres are said to dwell in big trees like acacias, mangoes,
    bamboo and banyan (known in the Philippines as balete). It is also mostly seen
    sitting under those trees."
