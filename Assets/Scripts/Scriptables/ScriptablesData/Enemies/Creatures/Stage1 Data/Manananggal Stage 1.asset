  enemyLore: 'The manananggal is a mythical creature in the Philippines that is able
    to separate its upper torso from the lower part of its body. Their fangs and
    wings give them a vampire-like appearance.


    The manananggal is described
    as scary, often hideous, usually depicted as female, and always capable of severing
    its upper torso and sprouting huge bat-like wings to fly into the night in search
    of its victims. The word manananggal comes from the Tagalog word tanggal, which
    means "to remove" or "to separate", which literally translates as "remover" or
    "separator". In this case, "one who separates itself". The name also originates
    from an expression used for a severed torso.



    The manananggal is said to
    favor preying on sleeping, pregnant women, using an elongated proboscis-like
    tongue to suck the hearts of fetuses, or the blood of someone who is sleeping.
    It also haunts newlyweds or couples in love and sometimes a new born child. Due
    to being left at the altar, grooms-to-be are one of its main targets.


    The
    severed lower torso is left standing, and is the more vulnerable of the two halves.
    Sprinkling salt, smearing crushed garlic or ash on top of the standing torso
    is fatal to the creature. The upper torso then would not be able to rejoin itself
    and would perish by sunrise.['
