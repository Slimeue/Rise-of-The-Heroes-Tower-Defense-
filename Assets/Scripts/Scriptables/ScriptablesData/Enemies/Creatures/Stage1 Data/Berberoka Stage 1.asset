  enemyLore: 'The Berberoka is a water spirit or ghost that lives in the wetlands,
    lakes, or swamps. It can lure its victims by drinking a lot of water. When humans
    try to catch it, it floods and drowns them, and it makes dinner out of them as
    well. There is not a clear description of what a Berberoka is, though it could
    be a ghost or a creature that looks like a shadow or a chameleon.



    In tropical
    regions, where berberoks are commonly found, locals tend to give empty ponds
    wide berth, even though the fish are tempting. Hungry travelers may believe that
    the bounty offered by the berberoka is a blessing, but they might end up getting
    swept away by its deadly force.'
