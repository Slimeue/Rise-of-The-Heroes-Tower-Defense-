  charLore: "Known for being one of the greatest Datu when it came to fighting prowess,
    the story of Bantugen delves deeply into his fight against the enemy of their
    land and the romances between him and all the girls he fell in love with. However,
    his older brother Morog forbids him to marry any of those ladies despite their
    unparalleled beauty \u2013 for none of these women could match or equal the power
    and the richness of Bantugen. As a warrior, Bantugen\u2019s battlefield abilities
    make him one of the most formidable opponents to wage war with. He can travel
    into the sky and even walk on the surface of water. He also has the power to
    call upon the help of Anito to do his bidding. This was because he was the descendant
    of Maria Makilling, a lesser divine spirit closer to an elemental. The Elemental
    watching over Bantugen also owns a Bangka (boat) that can travel like a submarine
    in the deepest part of the ocean and can carry nearly the total population of
    a village."
