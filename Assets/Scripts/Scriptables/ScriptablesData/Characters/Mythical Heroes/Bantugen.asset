  charLore: "Prince Bantug\xEBn is a courageous warrior in the epic of the people
    of Darang\xEBn of the M\xEBranaw. He is known for his kingdom, Bumbaran, due
    to the victories he achieved in battles.\r\n\r\nA symbol of bravery and valor,
    Prince Bantug\xEBn is widely renowned in their kingdom of Bumbaran, especially
    among the maidens. It is said that he courted 50 of the most beautiful princesses
    in the world. Because of this, his older brother, King Madali, became extremely
    jealous of him. Madali prohibited anyone from speaking to his brother.\r\n\r\nIn
    deep sorrow, Bantug\xEBn left their kingdom until he fell ill and died near the
    Kingdom of the Land Between Two Seas. The king and Princess Datimbang saw Bantugan's
    body and immediately reported the news to the council. A parrot entered and revealed
    who the deceased traveler was and where he came from.\r\n\r\nUpon learning this,
    King Madali retrieved his brother's soul from the heavens to restore it to Bantug\xEBn's
    body. The news of his resurrection spread, reaching the enemy kingdom and King
    Miskoyaw. Miskoyaw's soldiers attacked Bumbaran and captured Prince Bantug\xEBn,
    weakened in body. When his strength returned, he defeated the enemy king's army
    and saved the entire Bumbaran. They celebrated grandly, and the jealousy in King
    Madali's heart disappeared. Prince Bantug\xEBn lived a long and joyful life in
    the kingdom of Bumbaran with the princesses he married."
