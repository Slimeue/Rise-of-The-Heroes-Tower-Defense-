  lorePart1: "Lumalindaw is the hero from epic tales of theGa\u2019dang people.\n\n
    He is the son of Datu Lumalibacfrom Nabbobawan. \n\nThe tales of Lumalindaw are
    a series of romantic pursuits with our hero fighting for all the women he loves.
    such as the fierce bolo combat with the brother of Menalam."
  lorePart2: "He even broke the curse of the sirena, Carinuwan, that made her regain
    human form.  \n\nHis pure heart also made him save the beautiful dwarf Caligayan
    of the underworld and return her to normal size. This latter had came to the
    earth after being cursed, in search of a potential cure for it. \n\nLumalindaw
    was an extraordinary individual since his birth."
  lorePart3: "He is a proficient player of the Ayoding; a magical music instrument
    that also acts as a guiding voice whenever he makes a decision. He has armed
    himself with a bolo blade that emits a blinding light (similiar to what ozy describes
    Moses' staff, basically sword beam) and produces music whenever it is swing.
    \n\nThe conclusion of the adventure of Lumalindaw is quiet melancholic, for unlike
    other epics that end in glorious triumph, Lumalindaw\u2019s tale ended when he
    left all his sons and daughters and entered the cave behind a waterfall, which
    symbolized his death"
  personalityPart1: "Lumalindaw is a quite diligent and strong-willed person, he
    acts very friendly with everyone, handing smiles like a billionaire spnds money.
    \n\nAlthough with his friendly nature, he is frequently overreacting to abnormal
    situations with exaggerated expressions."
  personalityPart2: "Due to having been on many adventures, Lumalindaw is confident
    and brave person, eventually developing leadership skills. \n\nBecause of his
    practice during many fights, Lumalindaw has developed a great analytical mind
    and can form complex battle plans in seconds, which factor in both his allies'
    and enemies\u2019. \n\nDespite not possessing such skill as Eye of the Mind or
    tactics of sort, he was noted to hold such ability. "
  personalityPart3: "Although out of combat, he externalizes his observations through
    endless mumbling, a habit which annoys or scares his peers. Lumalindaw appears
    to have a more brash and abrasive side to him. \n\nThis typically shows up when
    he finds himself in combat. He has also admitted that he doesn't like this side
    of him very much and tends to keep it in check. Lumalindaw often helps people
    with personal and emotional problems, even if it does not concern him. He simply
    has such empathic nature that makes it so he cannot leave anyone alone when they
    are troubled. \n\nIt could nonetheless lead him to be unduly meddlesome, annoying
    a few people he tried to help. Still, Lumalindaw's heroic spirit is recognized
    by many, having earned the loyalty and gratitude of conquests and people he met.
    Lumalindaw's natural charm and his heroic spirit in such way are what made his
    tale to be so keen to romantic adventures. \n\nLumalindaw is a caring person
    and never hesitates to rescue someone in danger, even if he knows that he is
    not strong enough to do it. Often, he does this on a whim, taking a more careless
    approach than the usual overthinking he goes through."
