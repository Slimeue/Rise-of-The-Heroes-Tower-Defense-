  lorePart1: "Legend has it that Bantug\xEBn can fly in the heavens, walk on water,
    and breathe underwater for a long time. \n\nHe also has the power to rule over
    all kinds of anito, a lineage of spirits that dwell in nature.\n\nBantug\xEBn\u2019s
    preferred mode of transportation is a giant wooden ship, \n\r"
  lorePart2: "which can carry a whole town of warriors. \n\nHis most prized possession
    is the kampilan, a single-edged sword distinct for its tapered blade that's broad
    and thin at the end. It sometimes has a spikelet at the tip\n\nAs the second
    son of Tominaman sa Rogong and Lalawanen sa Solog, it is his responsibility to
    rule over Bembaran and protect his people."
  lorePart3: "Bembaran, described as a city near a great river, was founded by Bantug\xEBn's
    grandfather. \nHe has 12 brothers, three sisters, and seven sons. Two of his
    offspring, Sayana and Lomna, have their own tales of adventure and heroism in
    the Darang\xEBn.\r\nAccording to a translation in The Journal of American Folklore,
    one of the adventures of Bantug\xEBn is a two-day journey in the valley of the
    Rio Grande de Mindanao. A huge hurricane carries the house of his sister named
    Alcat from the village of Bembaran to the seacoast, where it is seen by Spanish
    general Minda- lunu sa Tunu-Miducau sa da Uata. The general puts Alcat's house
    on the warszhip and takes her to Sugurungan a Lagat, where the king is named
    Dumakulay Amalana Dumombang Mapamatu.\r\nWhen Bantug\xEBn finds out that her
    sister is captured, he tells his men to launch all his ships and prepare his
    brothers for battle. Upon arriving in Sugurungan a Lagat, the village of the
    Spaniards immediately fires at his warship, which remains unscathed. The battle
    between the Spaniards and Bantug\xEBn continues for seven days, but the warrior's
    ship is still undamaged. Faced with the threat that this could go on for years,
    the king agrees to return Alcat to her brother and let them all go."
  personalityPart1: "Bantugen had always been calm, cold-blooded and had barely ever
    shown any affection towards anyone. \n\nEven in his early life, he had only cared
    for his family, and a handful of his mates. \n\nBantugen would often show compassion
    towards people in distress, "
  personalityPart2: "but when it came to actually caring for them, he'd politely
    decline. \n\nHe is not the type of person to easily show affection to anyone,
    enjoying the beauties of the world is one thing. \n\nBut actually having feelings
    for the person is entirely another thing for him. \n\nHe was very listening toward
    his older brother, as despitw the woman's beauties, he could let them go in half
    a second and very harshly."
  personalityPart3: "Bantugen was a man of strong character, was quite hardworking
    and extremely stubborn, and always took things his way, but still kept his promises
    no matter what; these were some of his most remarkable features.\n\nIf he swore
    to help someone, he will do so until the very end. No matter the hardships, he
    will uphold his promises. \n\nHowever, his personality was governed by another
    very major attribute; he simply couldn't hold back his grievances. \n\nHe would
    always show his revenge tenfold, a hundredfold to what he had been through."
