  lorePart1: 'Gregorio "Goyo" del Pilar was a key figure in Philippine history, known
    for his role in the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonization and the
    subsequent Philippine-American War. Born on November 14, 1875, del Pilar became
    one of the youngest generals in the revolutionary forces.

'
  lorePart2: 'During the Philippine-American War, he played a significant role in
    the Battle of Tirad Pass in 1899, where he fought against American forces. Despite
    his efforts, the battle ended in defeat, but del Pilar''s bravery and commitment
    to the cause of Philippine independence left a lasting legacy.


    Del Pilar''s
    loyalty to the revolutionary leader Emilio Aguinaldo earned him both admiration
    and criticism. He was often regarded as Aguinaldo''s favorite, but this loyalty
    led to accusations of being Aguinaldo''s henchman.'
  lorePart3: 'Beyond his military prowess, del Pilar was known for his charisma and
    romantic pursuits. Despite his outward confidence, he grappled with inner demons,
    including trauma from the battles he participated in, leading to psychological
    struggles.



    Gregorio del Pilar died at the young age of 24 during the Battle
    of Tirad Pass. His life and legacy are remembered as part of the complex and
    tumultuous period in Philippine history marked by the struggle for independence
    against foreign powers.'
  personalityPart1: Goyo was defined to be a kind and charming fellow of the youth
    who had huge dreams for himself and had a clear vision for his dreams until before
    the Philippine Revolution broke out and he decided to join the revolution. Due
    to his looks, he also had adapted the personality of vanity and narcissism.
  personalityPart2: 'Being attributed to be considered as an eagle, Goyo displayed
    the skills and abilities of one for being patient and soft-spoken, but would
    attack head-on when given the opportunity.  One of his most known trait was for
    being undeniably loyal to the point of not recognizing the blurred line that
    differentiates idolatry and fighting for principles, one that had been a heavy
    theme throughout Goyo: Ang Batang Heneral for being Aguinaldo''s favorite.  Due
    to his blinded loyalty, he was called to be considered not a soldier or hero,
    but Aguinaldo''s henchman or even be disintegrated to be called as a "dog" by
    Manuel Bernal.'
  personalityPart3: 'It had been reasoned that Goyo will do anything given that it
    had been ordered by Aguinaldo at any means. Though he could be calloused to others,
    even not showing respect among his superiors, except for Aguinaldo, most of the
    times, he remained calm and respect them as long as he can do so.


    Contrary
    for his almost blinded loyalty, Goyo was known to be a ladies'' man and a heart
    breaker, one that could even rivaled that of Rizal if he had lived on to survive
    Tirad Pass. He was a smooth-talker, sweet, friendly, gentleman, and confident.
    It had been mentioned that he had a girl in every town he visited; but he somehow
    had been different when it had come towards his last lover, Remedios.

    But
    behind all of his greatness, courage and confidence, Goyo was revealed to have
    an inner demon that he had been fighting for too long on his own. He had remained
    in trauma of the battles he had participated in and the words of truth that he
    knew deep down but tried to neglect. His trauma had caused him ngihtmares, hallucinations,
    self-pity, uncontrolled anxieties and insecurities, and even situations of looking
    at the distance in wonder. Fighting off those demons of him often lead him to
    close-death scenarios or trouble; as well as having visions of his own death.'
