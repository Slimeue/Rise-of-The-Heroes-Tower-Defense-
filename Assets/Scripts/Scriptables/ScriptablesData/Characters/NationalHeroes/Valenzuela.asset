  charLore: "P\xEDo Valenzuela y Alejandrino was a Filipino physician and revolutionary
    leader who played a crucial role in the independence movement of the Philippines
    from Spanish colonial rule. Born on July 11, 1869, and passing away on April
    6, 1956, he joined the Katipunan society at the age of 23. Alongside Andr\xE9s
    Bonifacio and Emilio Jacinto, they established the secret chamber within the
    society known as Camara Reina. Valenzuela was responsible for overseeing the
    publication of Ang Kalayaan, the Katipunan's inaugural and sole official publication.\r\n\r\nValenzuela
    even made efforts to persuade the exiled Jos\xE9 Rizal to join the revolutionary
    cause. When the Katipunan was eventually uncovered, he fled to Balintawak (now
    part of Quezon City) on August 20, 1896. Subsequently, he decided to avail of
    an amnesty offered by the Spanish colonial government, surrendering on September
    1, 1896. Following his surrender, he was deported to Spain and endured trials
    and imprisonment in Madrid before being transferred to M\xE1laga and eventually
    a Spanish outpost in Africa. His incarceration lasted for approximately two years.\r\n\r\nUpon
    his return to the Philippines in April 1899, Valenzuela resumed his medical practice.
    However, the American authorities, fearing that he might incite insurrection,
    promptly arrested him. His election as municipal president in his hometown of
    Polo forced the Americans to release him from prison. Between 1921 and 1925,
    he served as the governor of the province of Bulacan."
