  charLore: "Mariano Ponce y Collantes, commonly known as Mariano Ponce, was a Filipino
    physician, writer, statesman, and an active member of the Propaganda Movement.
    He was born on March 22, 1863, and passed away on May 23, 1918. Ponce played
    a pivotal role in the movement for Filipino independence. In Spain, he was one
    of the founders of La Solidaridad and Asociaci\xF3n Hispano-Filipino.\r\n\r\nOne
    of his notable contributions was \"Efemerides Filipinas,\" a column focusing
    on historical events in the Philippines, which was published in La Oceania Espa\xF1ola
    from 1892 to 1893 and later in El Ideal from 1911 to 1912. Ponce also authored
    \"Ang Wika at Lahi\" in 1917, a work that discussed the significance of a national
    language for the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his literary and intellectual
    pursuits, Mariano Ponce served as the representative of Bulacan in the Philippine
    Assembly from 1909 to 1912, actively participating in the political development
    of the Philippines."
